                <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2025</p>

                <p>
                    Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the GoGBA 
                    mobile application ("App") operated by us ("we", "our", or "us").
                </p>

                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    By downloading, installing, or using GoGBA, you agree to be bound by these Terms. 
                    If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
                <p>
                    GoGBA is a Game Boy Advance (GBA) game emulator application that allows you to 
                    play GBA games on your mobile device. The App provides emulation functionality 
                    using the libretro gpSP core.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Legal Use and ROM Files</h2>
                <h3>3.1 ROM Ownership</h3>
                <p>
                    You are solely responsible for ensuring that you have the legal right to use any 
                    ROM files you load into GoGBA. You must only use ROM files for games that you 
                    legally own.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 Copyright Compliance</h3>
                <p>
                    Downloading, distributing, or using ROM files for games you do not own is illegal 
                    and violates copyright laws. We do not provide, distribute, or facilitate access 
                    to ROM files. You are responsible for obtaining ROM files legally.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3 Our Position</h3>
                <p>
                    GoGBA is provided as an emulation tool. We do not endorse or encourage piracy. 
                    We are not responsible for how you use the App or any ROM files you may use with it.
                </p>

                <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>You agree to:</p>

                    <li>Not use the App to violate any laws or regulations</li>
                    <li>Not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
                    <li>Not remove or alter any copyright notices or proprietary markings</li>
                </ul>
